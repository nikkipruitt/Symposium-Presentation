#Eye of the Tiger: A  Study of Artificial Life
##Student Symposium Presentation 
###Shannon Bolton and Nikki Pruitt
###Presentation Date: February 17, 2016

##Abstract
Can computers simulate how creatures evolve over time? Using NetLogo, we will simulate how “tigers” evolve over time to ensure the best offspring survive. The tigers will each feature a sector of vision. These vision sectors all have the same area, but different distances from their body. The tigers will need to hunt one another to survive. There will also be other environmental variables that can potentially affect the tigers. Through the simulation, we can see whether a longer or shorter cone of vision would be more beneficial for survival. 

##Vision Sector
![alt text](https://github.com/nikkipruitt/Symposium-Presentation/blob/master/cone.png "Vision Sector")
* θ represents the central angle of the sector 
* d represents the distance of the vision sector
* Area is consitent for all vision sectors

##Behaviors
* Wander
  * default state of the tigers
  * tigers move around and wait for another tiger to cross its vision cone before turning to hunt
* Hunt
  *
*Eat
  *
*Reproduce
